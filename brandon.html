        <p>Hi, my name is Brandon. I am a 24 year old self-taught developer. I like football, basketball, and gaming when I have free time. I am eager to enter this new job force, having the drive for knowledge and to better my skills. My skills at the moment aren't high level, but I can promise I wont give up on a task, even if it's out of my technique. I will find a way to learn, and correct anything to get the job done. I would love for someone to give me the opportunity to code, even though I am new to the coding world. I would appreciate mentorship as well as striving to make a difference to a company that is willing to teach me new things. I enjoy coding on my own time, and find it interesting how there is so many levels and depths to the system. My current knowledge is HTML CSS and Javascript. I will continue to capture more codes as I go. </p>
